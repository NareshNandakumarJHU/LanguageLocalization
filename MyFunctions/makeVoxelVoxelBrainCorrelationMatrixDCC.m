function wholebrain = makeVoxelVoxelBrainCorrelationMatrixDCC(X,Y,Z,img,comparisonseed,CorrelationMatrix)

%wholebrain will be a 4-D matrix of the correlations betweeen the
%comparisonseed and the rest of the voxels from Xstart to Xstop. The rest
%of the values will be zero. This code was written to break up the amount
%of times that the code to make the whole brain correlation would have to
%run by the x variable.
