function KDCC = clusteredDCC(discreteClusteredMatrix,img,x,y,z,d,clusternumber,comparisonseed,CorrelationMatrix)

%img is segmented by the cluster number given
%as the first dimension of centroid matrix from main
%script. discreteClusteredMatrix is a (x,y,z,T) matrix of
%integers from 1 to clusters (in first case, 17) showing which
%position gets what value. steps

%1. Use discrete clustered in correspondance with img to find
%the 17 clusters.
%2. Find an average time course for each of 17 clusters
%3. run DCC with those time courses and the comparison seed
%4. fill in correlation matrix with corresponding coordinates taken
%from discrete clustered matrix
